## Projects


Producer Aliment List App: A Technical Deep Dive
Built with React Native and empowered by modern Hooks.

React Native CLI:

Cross-Platform Powerhouse: Develop once, deploy everywhere! Leveraging React Native CLI, the app thrives across mobile platforms (iOS & Android) with a shared codebase.
Hooking Up Performance and Functionality:

useEffect: Handles side effects like fetching producer data and managing subscriptions, ensuring optimal performance and data freshness.
useState: Manages dynamic app state, making user interactions like filtering and searching a breeze.
useReduce: Transforms complex data manipulation into simple, efficient reducers, enabling lightning-fast filtering and aggregation of producer aliments based on diverse criteria.
useMemo: Optimizes expensive computations like distance calculations, preventing unnecessary re-renders and keeping the UI smooth and responsive.
